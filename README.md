# Blockchain Repo
Hi Everyone! 
A bit of a guide to help you navigate my Blockchain repo
--> ERC20 and ERC721 are literally that, they contain codes written in the ERC20 and ERC721 standard. These are inspired by OpenZeppelin.
--> Blockchain Demo is actually a Java Blockchain demo
--> NodeJS Implementation is a NodeJS Blockchain networking protocol demo. It is still based on localhost though.
