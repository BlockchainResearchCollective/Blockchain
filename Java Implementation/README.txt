This is my attempt at a Java-based implementation of a blockchain.
The scenario is an "AcademiCoin", which is a non-transactional blockchain between accredited universities and companies to obtain tamper-proof, accredited student certifications.

The blockchain implementation should be done, with additional files for transactional purposes (I know, I said its not transactional but it was just to see if I could do one)
Next phase: implementing p2p networking capabilities.
Third phase: generating consensus
